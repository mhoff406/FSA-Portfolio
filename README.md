# FSA-Portfolio

In order to run all of the code:

1) The user needs to be running a local server. The easiest way is through a python server that is pointed to the files location.
2) Once the server is running, open a browser and type in "http://localhost:8000" and select "Federal_Student_Loan.html". This will open the portfolio page.
